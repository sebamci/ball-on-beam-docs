Welcome to the Ball-on-Beam Control Platform Course!

This course serves as technical documentation and a structured introduction to a low-cost Ball-on-Beam platform, developed and optimized as part of a bachelor's thesis at Management Center Innsbruck (MCI).

The Ball-on-Beam system is a classical control engineering benchmark. It provides an ideal foundation for learning and applying model-based control strategies such as PID control, Lagrangian modeling, and lead compensation in a real-world setup.

In this course, you will:

- explore the mechanical and electronic design of the platform
- learn how to integrate sensors (e.g., soft potentiometers) and actuators (e.g., servos)
- build and adapt Simulink models for system control
- utilize simulation and real-time interfaces
- and bring the system to life through calibration and testing

The content is hands-on and application-oriented: step-by-step guides, visual explanations, and example models help you implement everything efficiently.

🔧 Ready? Let’s bring classic control engineering to life — one beam, one ball at a time.
