# Wiring

The wiring of the Ball-on-Beam platform is straightforward. All electronic components are pre-wired or connected directly to the corresponding headers on the custom Arduino shield.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Connect all components to the shield**
    - Connect the SoftPot sensor, rotary knob, pushbutton, and NeoPixel modules to their designated ports on the Arduino shield, one cable at a time.
    - Make sure to guide each cable through the corresponding slots in the base plate to maintain a clean and organized layout.
    - All connectors are labeled and polarized to prevent incorrect connections.


2. **Check signal and power connections**
    - Make sure each sensor and interface element is connected to both signal and ground/power as specified.
    - Double-check that the servo motor is connected to the dedicated PWM output.

3. **Cable Management**
    - Use the provided cable ties to neatly secure all wiring to the underside of the base plate.
    - Ensure that no cables interfere with the beam or mechanical movement.
    - Leave enough slack for serviceability, especially near the servo linkage.
