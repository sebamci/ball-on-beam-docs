# Preparing the Beam

The beam is the core mechanical element that supports the ball and is rotated by the servo motor. It must be mounted precisely and rotate freely.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Insert the steel axles**
   - Push the rotational shafts into the beam ends.
   - Use light press-fit or adhesive if required.

2. **Attach the servo arm adapter**
   - Mount the servo horn or 3D-printed adapter to one end of the beam.
   - Ensure solid mechanical connection and correct angle offset.

3. **Check the ball track**
   - The beam must feature a centered groove or flat zone for the ball.
   - Smooth the surface to reduce rolling resistance.
