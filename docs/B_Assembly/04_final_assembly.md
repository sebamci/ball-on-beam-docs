# Final Mechanical Assembly

In this final step, all subassemblies are brought together to complete the Ball-on-Beam platform.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Mount the Top Plate onto the Base Plate**
    - Carefully align the top plate with the spacers on the base plate.
    - Secure the top plate using 6 M4 screws inserted from above.
      

2. **Install the Beam**
      - Place the ball bearings into the dedicated bearing recesses on both sides of the top plate’s beam support structure and place the beam in between the brackets of the top plate.
      - Slide the beam axle through the previously inserted bearings.
      - Insert the precision-ground shaft pin through the beam, centering it so that the threaded ends extend equally on both sides.
      - On each side, fasten the shaft using two M6 nuts.
      - Tighten the nuts gently—firm enough to stabilize the beam, but loose enough to allow free rotation over the bearings.

3. **Connect the Servo Rod to the Beam**
      - Attach the rod end of the servo linkage to the designated hole on the beam side.
      - Use a single M3 screw with two washers and a nut to secure the connection.
      - Verify that the linkage moves freely and without mechanical tension.

Once all components—including the top plate, beam with bearings, and servo linkage—are installed and adjusted, the Ball-on-Beam system is fully assembled and ready for calibration.
