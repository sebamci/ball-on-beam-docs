# Assemble the Top Plate

The top plate defines the rotational axis of the beam by holding two precision ball bearings. It is mounted above the base using standoffs.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Install the Servo on the Top Plate**
    - Use the provided carriage bolts together with the Plexiglas spacers, and fasten them securely using the M6 nuts.
    - Ensure the Plexiglas spacers are aligned with the servo motor's rotation axis.
    - Insert the servo motor between the spacers and secure it with the retaining bracket and two more M6 nuts.

2. **Assemble the Servo Horn**
    - Attach the servo horn to the shaft of the servo motor.  
    - Make sure to align the horn at a 90° angle when the servo is in its full up position.
    - Secure the horn using the provided M2.5 screw. Tighten it firmly, but avoid over-tightening to prevent thread damage.

    - Now you can screw together the two rod ends and use the M3 screw and nut with two washers to secure the rod end to the servo horn.

3. **Attach Beam Support Brackets**

    - Insert the beam support brackets into the designated slots on the top plate.
    - Add the spacers and secure them with the provided M4 threaded rods and nuts.

Once all components—the servo motor, servo horn linkage, and beam support brackets—are securely mounted, the top plate assembly is complete. The result should match the configuration shown below.
