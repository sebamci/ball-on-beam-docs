# Assembly

This section provides a complete guide for assembling the Ball-on-Beam control platform. The mechanical and electrical structure is composed of five main parts:

1. The **Base Plate**, which houses the electronic components and user interface
2. The **Top Plate**, which holds the bearings and defines the beam axis
3. The **Beam**, which guides the ball and interfaces with the actuator
4. The **Final Mechanical Assembly**, where all components are integrated into a working system
5. The **Wiring**, which connects all electronic components for functionality

Each subchapter provides step-by-step instructions along with visual references from the 3D model or real system.
