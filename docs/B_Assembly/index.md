# Mechanical Assembly

This section provides a complete guide for assembling the Ball-on-Beam control platform. The mechanical structure is composed of four main parts:

1. The **Base Plate**, which houses the electronic components and user interface,
2. The **Top Plate**, which holds the bearings and defines the beam axis,
3. The **Beam**, which guides the ball and interfaces with the actuator,
4. The **Final Assembly**, where all components are integrated into a working system.

Each subchapter provides step-by-step instructions along with visual references from the 3D model.
